Open Analytics
==============

OA is a http api written in rust. Mostly written as a way to explore rust and
the new generation of strongly typed languages, I'm also interested in a way to
siphon iOS analyics data away from closed silos like Fabric.

The eventual goal is to develop applications _around_ an analytics pipeline.
The next step is an iOS client to spilt the analytics data across multiple
services. Since I'm working with React Native currently, a simple JS logger
might be enough to get going!
